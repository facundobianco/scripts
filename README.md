This is my personal scripts repository.

I think you can understand which every script does. In case you have a
doubt, I explain about them in my blog at [van.do](http://van.do)

NOTE: Shell scripts with wget command inside use `--no-verbose` option
for less printing but showing progress bar, see 
[this patch](https://mytechrants.wordpress.com/2009/11/26/wget-add-progressbar-nv/)
